These four shell scripts are used to calculate the Fe–dislocation interactions. 
The scripts take the strain file of the Fe atom as input and then automatically compute the λ-tensor (Eqs. 2~6), λ'-tensor (Eq. 8), interaction energy Eint (x,y) (Eq. 7), and interaction force F(x) (Eq. 9). 
The dislocation stress field has already been embedded in the scripts according to the dislocation type. 
The off-center directions of the Fe atom has also been written into the scripts, with the corresponding scripts placed in the LS1, LS2, and LS3 folders, respectively.
